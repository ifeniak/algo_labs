##Laboratory work 2 (data structures)
One of the data structures should be implemented.
0 - Stack (based on double-linked list)
1 - Queue with priorities
2- Bilateral queue (based on double-linked list)
3- Binary (or Binary) search tree
4 - Hash table
You should perform the operations of inserting, returning an element without deleting, deleting (for example, returning and deleting the first element from the stack), and finding a specific element (if such an operation is supported by the data structure)
